# Progressive-Budget

## Introduction

This Application is made for the person who loves to know what every single dollar of their hard earned money goes. This is your personal budget tracker. This application only requires you to add or subtract your funds and it will track them for the remainder of your time. This application works offline as well for flexible tracking.

## Description

This application was built using indexedDb and service workers for the main functionality. The indexedDb works through the client and allows for the application to store files within browser for flexible usage and offline capability.

## IndexedDb

This application uses IndexedDb for storing data within the client. IndexedDb is a transactional database systme that is a javascript object oriented database.
